# Scribble Project Status

## Current Status

Scribble is a notes management and digest generation tool that processes various file types, extracts information, and generates digests with AI assistance. The project has been successfully set up with the following components:

- Core note processing functionality
- Database for note storage and retrieval
- Digest generation for weekly and monthly summaries
- Web interface for interacting with the system
- PDF and image processing capabilities
- LLM integration for enhanced content analysis

The codebase has been successfully committed to GitHub with proper security practices in place.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing & Validation**: Create comprehensive tests for all core functionalities
2. **Documentation**: Improve inline documentation and readme with setup instructions
3. **User Experience**: Enhance the web interface with better navigation and visualization
4. **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks in file processing and improve speed
5. **Mobile Support**: Make the web interface responsive for mobile devices
6. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Tag management improvements
   - Custom digest generation options
   - Better search capabilities
   - Content recommendation engine

## Pain Points

1. **Configuration Management**: The need to manage API keys securely has been challenging, particularly when setting up version control
2. **PDF Processing**: Handling various PDF formats and extracting content reliably has been difficult
3. **Dependency Management**: Managing Python dependencies across different environments
4. **Performance with Large Files**: Processing large PDFs or images can be slow
5. **Data Security**: Ensuring sensitive information doesn't leak through logs or digests

## Improvement Opportunities

1. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement environment variable based configuration
   - Add proper authentication for web interface
   - Create a secure API key rotation system

2. **Architecture Improvements**:
   - Separate front-end and back-end more cleanly
   - Implement better async processing for large files
   - Create modular plugins for different file types

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - Add containerization (Docker) for easier setup
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Create developer documentation

4. **User Experience**:
   - Add customizable themes
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Implement progress indicators for long-running tasks

5. **AI Enhancements**:
   - Fine-tune prompts for better content analysis
   - Add multi-model support for different types of analysis
   - Implement feedback mechanism to improve AI results

## Immediate Priorities

1. Set up proper environment configuration (`.env` file)
2. Create basic test suite
3. Improve installation documentation
4. Fix the most critical bugs in PDF processing
5. Optimize database queries for better performance
